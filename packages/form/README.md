      label: 'Email',
      rules: [
        Rules.required(),
        Rules.email(),
      ],
    ),
    'password': TextFieldState(
      null,

      rules: [
        Rules.required(),
        Rules.minLength(8),
      ],
    ),
  },
);

final loginController = LogiFormController();

void main() {
  // Update the form fields
  loginController.updateText('email', 'salahnahed@icloud.com');
  loginController.updateText('password', 'password123');

// Print the updated values
  print('Email value: ${loginForm.textFieldValue('email')}');
  print('Password value: ${loginForm.textFieldValue('password')}');

// Let's assume we want to submit the form now
  loginController.submit();
}
