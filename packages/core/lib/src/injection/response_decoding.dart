/// A mixin providing a dynamic response conversion method using factory mapping.
///
/// This mixin offers a flexible way for service providers to convert JSON data into
/// their associated models or entities using a centralized factory map. When a class
/// mixes in `ResponseDecoding`, it can define a [factories] map to specify the
/// conversion logic for different models.
///
/// It's typically used in conjunction with [ServiceProvider] implementations to
/// offer a unified method for transforming JSON data into app-specific models.
///
/// The method [responseConvert] dynamically uses the [factories] map to convert
/// JSON data into the appropriate model. If no conversion is defined for a type,
/// it defaults to returning `null`.
///
/// Usage:
///
/// ```dart
/// class MyServiceProvider with ResponseDecoding {
///   @override
///   Map<Type, JsonFactory> get factories => {
///     MyModel: (json) => MyModel.fromJson(json),
///     AnotherModel: (json) => AnotherModel.fromJson(json),
///     // Add other model factories as needed...
///   };
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This approach centralizes the conversion logic, reducing boilerplate code
/// and making it easier to maintain and scale.

  /// it returns `null`.

  /// - Parameter [json] The JSON map that needs to be converted.
  /// - Returns: An instance of type [T] if the conversion is successful; otherwise, `null`.
